**Build the mind and hand of a Google Certified ML professional**

## What is this book about?

This book aims to provide a study guide to learn and master machine learning in Google Cloud: to build a broad and strong knowledge base, train hands-on skills, and get certified as a Google Cloud Machine Learning Engineer.

The book is for someone who has the basic Google Cloud Platform (GCP) knowledge and skills, and basic Python programming skills, and wants to learn machine learning in GCP to take their next step toward becoming a Google Cloud Certified Machine Learning professional.

The book starts by laying the foundations of Google Cloud Platform and Python programming, followed the by building blocks of machine learning, then focusing on machine learning in Google Cloud, and finally ends the studying for the Google Cloud Machine Learning certification by integrating all the knowledge and skills together.

The book is based on the graduate courses the author has been teaching at the University of Texas at Dallas. When going through the chapters, the reader is expected to study the concepts, complete the exercises, understand and practice the labs in the appendices, and study each exam question thoroughly. Then, at the end of the learning journey, you can expect to harvest the knowledge, skills, and a certificate.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Provision Google Cloud services related to data science and machine learning
* Program with the Python programming language and data science libraries
* Understand machine learning concepts and model development processes
* Explore deep learning concepts and neural networks
* Build, train, and deploy ML models with Google BigQuery ML, Keras, and Google Cloud Vertex AI
* Discover the Google Cloud ML Application Programming Interface (API)
* Prepare to achieve Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer certification

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
html, body, #map {
height: 100%;
margin: 0;
padding: 0
}
```
**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for business intelligence (BI) developers and data analysts who are looking to create interactive dashboards using data from Lake House on AWS with Amazon QuickSight. This book will also be useful for anyone who wants to learn Amazon QuickSight in depth using practical examples. You will need to be familiar with general data visualization concepts, however, no prior experience with Amazon QuickSight is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10 and Appendix 1-5).
